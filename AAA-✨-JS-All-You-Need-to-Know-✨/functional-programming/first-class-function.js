// First class function in Javascript. ✊

/*
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

▶️ Can be stored as a value in a variable
▶️ Can be returned by another function
▶️ Can be passed as a function's argument
▶️ Can be stored in an array, stack, or queue
▶️ Can have its own properties and methods.
